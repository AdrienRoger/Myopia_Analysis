# 1. **Preventive Measures**

## **Context and Background:**  
Myopia (nearsightedness) is a rapidly growing public health issue worldwide. Prevalence, especially among children, has dramatically increased over the past three decades. Both genetics (family history/parental myopia) and modifiable environmental/lifestyle risk factors (increased screen time, reduced outdoor activity, prolonged near work) are major contributors.

## **Why is Myopia a problem?**
- Leading cause of distance vision impairment globally.
- Uncorrected can impair education, employment, and quality of life.
- High myopia increases risk for blinding complications: retinal detachment, glaucoma, myopic maculopathy.
- Significant socioeconomic and healthcare expenditure worldwide.

## **Objectives:**
- Identify main determinants of myopia in children.
- Build and evaluate predictive models for myopia risk.
- Assess model interpretability and equity.
- Suggest interventions for effective prevention and early management.

## **Global Trends and Key Risk Factors**

### Increasing Prevalence

- Myopia prevalence among children rose from 10.4% (1993) to 34.2% (2016).
- By 2050, nearly **half of the global population** may be myopic, with ~10% at high risk of vision-threatening complications.
- Strongest increases observed in East and Southeast Asia, linked to urbanization, competitive education, and less time outdoors.

### Major Risk Factors

- **Environmental/Lifestyle:** High near work (screens, reading), low outdoor activity, intense academic pressures.
- **Genetic:** Children with myopic parents are at higher risk.
- **Regional/Ethnic differences** support gene-environment interaction as key.

# 2. Introduction

## 2.1 Context

Myopia (nearsightedness) is a rapidly rising global public health problem. Childhood myopia, especially in East and Southeast Asia, has soared over the past two decades. Environmental factors (screen time, urbanization) as well as genetic predisposition (parental myopia) drive this increase.

## 2.2 Objectives

- **Analyze** key determinants of myopia in children  
- **Develop** and evaluate risk prediction models  
- **Identify** prevention factors and possible intervention points  
- **Interpret** model features for clinical and public understanding  
- **Assess** equity and robustness of predictive models
